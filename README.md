> A lot of the services also support specific models for donators, but we are **just including the free tier** here. Some of these services give you rewards over time etc., but I'm assuming here that you only have ~10 mins of time.

For transparency: I, [@nsde](https://github.com/nsde), founded FoxGPT, but I'm not working on this project anymore. [@adi6409](https://github.com/adi6409) is.
