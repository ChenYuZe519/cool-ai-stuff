# Awesome Free AI APIs

This repository contains a list of free to use AI APIs.


You are welcome to contribute to this list by opening a pull request :)

***

A lot of the services also support ***-4 for donators, but we are just including the free tier here.

This table is under construction, and some cells are empty.

If \*\*\*-4 is free on the service, the restictions/rate limits are listed in the `***-4` column. If the service does not support ***-4, the `***-4` column will be "üö´".

"IP lock" means that the service only allows requests from a specific IP address. Often, you can reset the IP address in the Discord server of the service. If the service does not have an IP lock, the `No IP lock?` column will be "‚úÖ".

One can bypass this using a proxy.
